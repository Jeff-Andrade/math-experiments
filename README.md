This repository contains personal projects related to some applications in Mathematics and Statistics.

Mathematics:

    - Binary.py: converts a number from decimal to binary;
    - Collatz.py: implements the algorithm of the Collatz Conjecture;
    - Combinations.py: takes an array and uses the random module to generate and return its permutations;
    - Riemman Sum.py: given a function, a list containing the upper and lower bounds (respectively) and the desired amount of rectangles,
      approximates the area under the given function.

Statistics:

    - Frequency Table:

        - Frequency Table.py: given a list, Pandas series or array, generates a Pandas Data Frame containing a frequency table
        using class intervals, as well as the mean, average and standard deviation of the dataset.
        - data.txt: a sample dataset which can be used as parameter to generate the frequency table.
